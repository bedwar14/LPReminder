Liquid Planner Reminder

A script I wrote that I added to the task scheduler to remind me to enter hours into Liquid Planner.  If you run this from pythonw instead of python, it runs without the console.
The script just fades the background between red, green, and blue at a medium pace for one minute and then closes.
